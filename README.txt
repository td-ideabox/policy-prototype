## HEY GUS ##

So I decided to start a baby stub of something
sorta in the vein of what I mean when I say
hack away at something. 

I wrote this little program which runs one-way
of thinking about these policies against one way
of thinking about the city/community you're working
in. 

# TO PLAY WITH THIS STUFF

You'll need IDLE

I've emailed this to you, but I'm actually putting this code
up on github. 
https://github.com/

Search for "policy-prototype" and it should come up. Poke around
and see if you can figure out how to download it. Bonus points for
actually "cloning the repo" onto the laptop!
