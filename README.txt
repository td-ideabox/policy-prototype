## HEY GUS ##

So I decided to start a baby stub of something
sorta in the vein of what I mean when I say
hack away at something. 

I wrote this little program which runs one-way
of thinking about these policies against one way
of thinking about the city/community you're working
in. 

# TO PLAY WITH THIS STUFF

You'll need IDLE
https://www.python.org/downloads/

I've emailed this to you, but I'm actually putting this code
up on github. 
https://github.com/

Search for "policy-prototype" and it should come up. Poke around
and see if you can figure out how to download it. Bonus points for
actually "cloning the repo" onto the laptop!

If you actually start getting carried away with this stuff I'll
show you how to interact with git in a basic way. This is neat 
because then we can work together on projects and I can more easily
see your code so I can be of better help. Always feel free to ping
me with questions, I love this shit.
